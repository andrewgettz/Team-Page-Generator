# Team Contact Card Project 

## Description 

This application is a Node command line application that tahkes in information about your team members and generates an HTML webpage that displays the details you enter. 

The live page can viewed on Github Pages here: 

## Installation

To generate your own HTML team page, first download the repository and run `npm install` in order to install the following npm package dependencies as specified in the [`package.json`](https://github.com/connietran-dev/team-page-generator/blob/master/package.json):

* [`inquirer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) will prompt the user for the team member's email, id, and specific information based on their role with the company. For instance, an intern may provide their school, whereas an engineer may provide their GitHub username.
* [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/) will run unit tests to ensure that the `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Intern` objects are generated from their classes correctly.

Once you have `npm install` your dependencies, you can run the Node CLI application with `npm start` which will begin the questions about your engineering team. You can run the tests at any time with `npm test`.
